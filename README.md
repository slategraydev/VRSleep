# VRSleep
A minimal Electron app for automating simple VRChat tasks when you're sleeping. Auto respond to friend invite requests so they can join you, change your status automatically, and more!

## What it does
- Polls VRChat invite notifications at a configurable interval.
- If the sender is on your whitelist, sends an invite request back.
- Runs with a tiny renderer and low-RAM defaults so it doesn't take away resources from VR.

## Setup
1. Install dependencies.
2. Start the app.
3. Log in inside the app (supports 2FA).

```powershell
npm install
npm start
```

## Build an installer
This uses `electron-builder` to generate a Windows installer (NSIS).

```powershell
npm run dist
```

Output goes to `dist/`.

## Auto-updates (GitHub Releases)
VRSleep uses `electron-updater` to check GitHub Releases on startup. If an update is found, users are prompted to download and install it.

**Required:** update the GitHub repo info in `package.json`:

- `build.publish[0].owner`
- `build.publish[0].repo`

Then publish releases via GitHub, and the app will offer updates.

## Automatic releases on tag
This repo includes a GitHub Actions workflow that builds and publishes a release whenever you push a tag that starts with `v`.

```powershell
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
```

The workflow will build the Windows installer and attach it to the GitHub Release.

## Security
- Login cookies are stored encrypted using Electron safe storage.
- Use Logout to wipe stored credentials.

## Notes
- Whitelist entries can be VRChat user ids or display names (one per line).
